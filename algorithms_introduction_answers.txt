Instagram's algorithm for the Explore page. I always have content I am interested in clicking on.
Spotifiy's suggested artists page. The suggestions are usually close to what I am interested in.
Waze's suggested routes. They are usually the quickest, though not the easiest to follow.

An efficient algorithm takes the simplest and shortest path to accomplish a task. For example, if you are washing your dishes, it is probably easiest to wash all the dishes and then dry all the dishes instead of washing and drying each dish before cleaning the next one. The small steps to pick up the rag to dry a dish, put the rag back, etc. will save time if only done once, not twenty times.

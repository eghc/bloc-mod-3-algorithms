Short Answer

#1 What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?
I do not organize my t-shirts by certain colors/style/etc. so I have to do a linear search through my closet to find the shirt I am looking for.


#2 What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?
Binary search is used when looking for a word in a section of a dictionary. For example, you are looking for "computer", you know to start in the C section. Once you are there, it is best to perform a binary search since you know the words are in alphabetical order. 


#3 Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?
7


#4 Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?
2 


#5 Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.
Linear since that would be the only way to be 100% certain if the data you are looking for is there. The changes of a binary search working would be pretty slim.


#6 Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.
Binary since it should only take 6 iterations to find the data I am looking for.
